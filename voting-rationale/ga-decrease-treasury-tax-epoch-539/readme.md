# Monte Carlo Simulation to Support My Voting Rationale for the Governance Action "Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%"

## My Voting Decision

> I decided to vote **No** to this governance action.

I firmly believe that **a sustainable treasury is essential** for ensuring Cardano’s long-term resilience. Given the projected decline in treasury balance under the proposed tax reduction, I am inclined to vote **against** the reduction unless there is a **clear, alternative plan** to balance spending and revenue.

My decision is **not about opposing lower taxes or increased ADA circulation**—I recognize the benefits of allowing more ADA to be distributed through staking rewards. However, any reduction in treasury revenue must be accompanied by **a well-structured strategy** that:

* Aligns spending with new revenue expectations, ensuring funds are available for essential ecosystem development.  
* Encourages efficient use of treasury funds, avoiding unnecessary or excessive spending.  
* Explores **alternative funding mechanisms**, such as increasing transaction fee contributions to the treasury over time.

Without such a strategy, reducing the treasury tax **introduces financial risks** that could limit Cardano’s ability to **fund future development, governance, and community-driven projects**. Cardano's long-term health depends on **responsible financial stewardship**, and any governance action that impacts the treasury must be approached with careful consideration of its sustainability.

## Final Thought

My vote reflects my commitment to **preserving Cardano’s economic viability** while ensuring it remains a **self-sustaining and decentralized ecosystem**. I encourage all stakeholders to carefully evaluate the implications of this proposal and consider **not just the short-term benefits but also Cardano's long-term financial health**.

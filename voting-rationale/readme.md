1. Governance Action: [Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%](https://gov.tools/connected/governance_actions/941502b0aa104c850d197923259444d2b57cab7af18b63143775465aaacc84f5#0).

    * [I voted **No**](https://adastat.net/transactions/404521e551f589c4152cebaafa14f7ed7dc44609850c47de40e5f6d1d2b48870) to this Governance Action. [Here](ga-decrease-treasury-tax-epoch-539/readme.md) is my rationale.
